Here’s what the above code is doing:

Lines 3 to 6 import the built-in pathlib as well as the third-party libraries connexion, SQLAlchemy, and Marshmallow.

Line 8 creates the variable basedir pointing to the directory that the program is running in.

Line 9 uses the basedir variable to create the Connexion app instance and give it the path to the directory that contains your specification file.

Line 11 creates a variable, app, which is the Flask instance initialized by Connexion.

Line 12 tell SQLAlchemy to use SQLite as the database and a file named people.db in the current directory as the database file.

Line 13 turns the SQLAlchemy event system off. The event system generates events that are useful in event-driven programs, but it adds significant overhead. Since you’re not creating an event-driven program, you turn this feature off.

Line 15 initializes SQLAlchemy by passing the app configuration information to SQLAlchemy and assigning the result to a db variable.

Line 16 initializes Marshmallow and allows it to work with the SQLAlchemy components attached to the app.
